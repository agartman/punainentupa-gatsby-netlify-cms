### Listen to the customer and give feedback
As a consultant, I believe I'm expected to give my best recommendation to the in-house team and product owner. Before even going to technical implementation, it makes sense to evaluate the higher level concept as well. What do we want to achieve? Would THIS be something the users would find and actually use? Is THIS a future-proof approach or something that would be past time when launched? Through listening and simply experience, I always find something to give constructive feedback about and possibly give direction on the overall design. This is something I always try to apply in my work: listening.

### NOT re-inventing the wheel
Might sound like a cliche, but coding basic stuff from scratch happens all the time. I want to keep focus on the real project and utilize open source and SaaS services as much as it makes sense. I prefer to recommend reasonably priced well-established services, especially in prototyping, and concentrate on the beef of things.

### Prototyping
Now this is something I apply all the time. A prototype is the simplest form of presentation to test a concept or an idea. In other words it should be fast and simple and cheap. This could mean a bunch of post it notes to test a user story flow or this could be a vertical model of a planned software architecture, just to see if the whole thing makes sense. Prototyping makes a great basis for conversation, it's fun and usually gives direction for next steps.
